<body id="body">
    <h1>The Way Out!</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p id="desc">
            You walk through the hallway door and after some walking you make your way down some stairs and into what looks like the main lobby. On the other side of the room is a set of glass doors and outside a parking lot. But there is one BIG problem. Some Moster Dog thing is between you and that door. The Monster looks like it does not have eyes, but if there are no eyes it must have great hearing and sense of smell.
            <br><br>
            There seems to be three ways you can go. To the RIGHT it goes under the skylight and seems to have nothing large in the way. Off to the LEFT there is a mountain of ruble in the path from the ceiling that caved in. But that is the only thing of notice. And then there is right down the CENTER, but that is where the Monster Dog is so it is probably instant Death.
            <br><br>
            To your surprise the Madman never comes over the speaker seems like he finally learned to be quiet.
