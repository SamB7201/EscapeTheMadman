    <h1>The Truth</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p id="desc">
            You make your way up the stairwell and out onto the catwalk overviewing the main lobby. You look down as you walk for the Main Office, but something is missing. That Monster is gone, you look around to see if it somehow climbed up but it is just no where to be seen. You pick up the pace and get into the office closing the door behind you and locking it while facing the door.
            <br><br>
            As you are standing there in silence you half expected to hear that Madman standing behind you laughing, but there is nothing. You turn around and see an office that feels familiar. The it hits you, this is just like those aging offices but a few differences. The wall opposit of you still has a Window, and there is a Desk directly in front of it still. But to your right there is a Book shelf covering the wall, and to your left a TV.
            <br><br>
            Is this just another test or someting else?

But the person would need to WANT to search for who they are, so an enviroment would be created to have them look for their memories meanwhile the serum would cause them to hallucinate nightmarish things to get there nerves firing and on a hightened sense and eventually in their panic start remeberign things they have forgotten. <br><br>In the file was the name of the person conducting the research for the serum, 'H. Ashton' and also a picture of you. Just as you get to your picture it hits you like a wave everything you did up until this point, all the people you coaxed into working with you, the failed results.
