    <h1>Area 1: The Pit</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p id="desc">You find yourself waking up on the floor of some sort of pit meant to look like some sort of lab. The first thing you see is a
            wall of file cabinets, then a window that has a bright light coming from it, and a desk on the another side of you. But the most important
            thing you notice is the lift that goes to the next level and seems to be the only exit.
            <br><br>
            A loud voice  of a man comes over the speaker, unhinged would be a more fitting description. "So you're finally awake eh? Well good cause 
            you have a fun time ahead of you! And if you don't know what that fun is supposed to be well it is simple... ESCAPE ME!!!" The unhinged 
            voice of the man bursts out in laughter before cutting out.
