    <h1>AREA 2 - Offices</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p id="desc">You get to the top of the Lift and walk through the only door. On the other side of the door you find yourself standing in a ruined hallway. There are four office doors, two on each side of the hall and each door seems newer than the last, and one metal door at the end with an exit sign directly above it. You're about to make a mad dash for it when.
            <br><br>
            "It looks like you made it out of that pit just fine, keeping calm eh? Well we'll see how long that lasts. A word of warning don't get to close of a look at things." The madman's voice cuts out after his warning.
